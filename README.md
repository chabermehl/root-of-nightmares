# Root of Nightmares

*NB:* This is based on a single run through contest mode in which I did not necessarily do every role and some of this is divined via osmosis/talking to teammates/watching others.

## General Tips

* It's season of the void, use void if possible.
* Double special is viable if heavy ammo is an issue.

## 1st Encounter

### 1st Encounter - Setup

* 2 people connecting nodes.
  * Shoot initial node to get buff.
  * Once the buff is acquired it will point towards the node to connect.
  * One person should go, make a connection while the second person waits. Once the first connection is made the second person can activate the buff and find the next node.
    * This is important so that the node chaining can be sped up since the node connectors have to go all the way back to the original buff node.
  * Do not reacquire the buff until the person that currently has it has made their connection otherwise they will lose their buff.     
* Everyone else does add clear while looking for psions.
  * Kill 2 psions to spawn tormentor, killing tormentor extends wipe timer. If no wipe timer up, wait to kill if possible to get maximum timer.
* Has anti-barrier champs.

### 1st Encounter - Flow

* After enough nodes are connected the encounter will "move forward" in the area.
  * This happens after 5(?) node connections.
  * Psions will begin spawning in other spots, the initial node will move up.
  * After completeing 3(?) base nodes, the encounter is over.

## 2nd Encounter

This is another add clear encounter that revolves around connecting nodes.

### 2nd Encounter - Setup

* 2 sides, 3 floors.
* Split into two teams of 3.
  * 2 node connectors.
  * 1 add clear.
* Has anti-barrier champs.
* Machine guns are very good.

### 2nd Encounter - Flow

* Connecting nodes
  * One side starts with a dark node, the other light.
  * Everyone on each side gets initial buff.
  * 1st connector takes boop cannon across (light -> dark, dark -> light) and makes the connection to the associated node.
  * Once the 1st connector makes the connection, the buff can be reacquired by the remaining two on the original side.
  * While the 2nd connector does the next node, the 1st connector comes back to the original side to reacquire the buff.
  * Just like in the first encounter, reacquiring the buff will remove it from all others that currently have it.
  * Repeat this until all the light and dark nodes are connected across the chasm.
  * Once all nodes are connected, the last boop cannon will get its button which will launch you to the next floor.
  * Repeat the above on the next floor until all 3 floors are cleared.
* Add clear
  * Clear adds :)
  * The add clear person should always be reacquiring the light or dark buff on their side everytime a connecter does because there are light/dark shielded enemies that can only be broken while they have the buff.

### 2nd Encounter - Tips

* Stand as far back in the boop cannon as possible for best results.
  * Gamers can well/shatter skate across.

## 3rd Encounter

First boss encounter!

### 3rd Encounter - Setup

* 2 teams ish.
  * Each team has 2 planet runners.
  * Extra person just helps with adds, killing the colossus' as needed.
* 2 sides of the encounter.
  * Light side.
  * Dark side.
  * The goal is to move all light planets to the light side and dark planets to the dark side.
* The planets can be numbered 1-6 and are in the same position on both sides of the room.

### 3rd Encounter - Map

![3rd-encounter-map](/assets/third-encounter.png)

### 3rd Encounter - Flow

* Encounter starts.
* Kill centurions in middle area.
  * This will spawn 2 colossus'.
* Kill the colossus' to gain `Planetary Insight`
  * Use `Planetary Insight` to determine which planets need to be moved. 
  * Each side has two incorrect planets that need to be swapped.
* Determine which planets need to be swapped.
  * There will be 2 on each side.
* Each individual runner should go to an individual incorrect planet and interact with it.
* Each runner should then cross the arena to the opposite side.
  * Dark runners -> Light side
  * Light runners -> Dark side
* The inccorrect planets from one side should be deposited in the same place which the incorrect planets from the other came from.
  * Example:
    * Dark 1 and 6 are incorrect.
    * Light 3 and 4 are incorrect.
    * The dark runners interact with Dark 1 and 6.
    * The light runners interact with Light 3 and 4.
    * The runners then cross from their respective sides to the other.
    * The dark runners will deposit on Light 3 and 4.
    * The light runners will deposit on Dark 1 and 6.
  * You will know this was done correctly because the 2 sets of pillars on each side of the room will light up.
  * `Planetary Affinity` must be deposited before `Planetary Shift` runs out.
* Kill the next set of centurions to spawn the next set of colossus'.
  * If you failed to move all 4 incorrect planets, you can attempt to reconcile that now but note that you will be very close to if not headed straight for a wipe.
* After acquiring `Planetary Insight`, look at the planets above the 3 plates in the middle.
  * Each plate will have a light or dark planet above it.
  * 3 people then need to acquire 1 of each required planet and deposit them on the correct plate.
    * Example:
      * Left plate: Dark.
      * Middle plate: Dark.
      * Right plate: Light.
      * Acquire 2 dark planets and 1 light planet.
      * Deposit on their respective plates.
* After depositing, damage phase will start shortly after.
  * This damage phase is much like Caretaker where you will traverse from plate to plate doing damage for a short time on each plate.
  * The plate you stand on is determined by the color of the boss.
    * Orange-ish -> Dark
    * White-ish -> Light
  * Stand on the correct plate to do damage to the boss.
* After damage phase where final stand is not reached, begin moving planets to their correct side and so on again.
* If final stand is reached keep blasting until he is dead.
  * We did not need Outbreak for final stand.
  * Unsure of exact mechanics here, I believe we finsihed final stand in 1 or 2 plates and it was much like Caretaker again, moving from plate to plate though the color of the boss may not have mattered this time.        

### 3rd Encounter - Buffs

* `Planetary Insight`
  * Gained from killing the colossus' that spawn.
  * Allows the holder to see which planets are incorrect on each side of the room.
* `Planetary Affinity`
  * Gained by interacting with a planet on the side of the room.
  * This affinity can then be deposited on a planet on the other side of the room, the goal being to swap a light and dark planet.
* `Planetary Shift`
  * Gained after someone gains `Planetary Affinity`.
  * This is a timer for how long you have to run to the other side and deposit the `Planetary Affinity` buff.

### 3rd Encounter - Loadouts

* Longer range supers if using damage supers.
  * Tether, Nova Bomb etc.
* Well of Radiance will make this very easy.
* Add clear supers are also very good.
* Guns:
  * Divinity +
    * Thunderlord
    * Izzy + Rocket (has big crit spot and doesn't move so it may not be *strictly necessary* to have a div)
  * Untested/not seen in action: 
    * Grenade Launchers (probably not good).
    * Rockets Only (Ghorn, TTF, Legendaries). 
    * Fusion Grenade spam.

## 4th Encounter

Now it's time to fight Nezerac ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### 4th Encounter - Setup

* Encounter has 2 sides, Light and Dark.
* Requires 2 runners, 1 for each node chain.
* 4 remaining fire team members should focus on add clear and handling Nezerac.
* The goal of the runners is to connect both sets of Light and Dark nodes before Nezerac starts his wipe mechanic.
* Similar loadout as the 3rd encounter will work well here.
  * Well is very powerful, Thundercrash or any other high damager super is also viable.

### 4th Encounter - Flow

* Each runner starts at the beginning of their node chain.
* Each runner will then begin connecting the nodes ASAP.
  * On the first damage phase this can be speed ran and the anti-wipe mechanic can be ignored.
  * The anti-wipe mechanic will make things much easier in later node connection phases.
    * See [Anti-Wipe Mechanic](#4th-encounter---anti-wipe-mechanic) for more information.
* While the runners are connecting the nodes, one or two of the remaining fire team members should be ready to take `Nezerac's Hatred`.
  * While connecting the buffs, some fire team members will receive `Nezerac's Hatred`. 
  * This debuff will show as purple on the edges of their screen.
    * When this debuff is applied, call it out for the person taking `Nezerac's Hatred` since it is not necessarily obvious. 
    * The longer it goes on the worse it gets, evenutally booping the affected guardian into the air over and over again. 
  * This can be stopped by breaking Nezerac's crit spots.
  * The person that breaks the crit spot will then have `Nezerac's Hatred` but with a timer.
    * This timer can be refreshed by continuing to break Nezerac's remaining crit spots (shoulders).
    * For the most part you will just be running for your life though.
* Once the nodes are connected, move to the last Light node plate as it offers the most consistent damage phase.
  * Any plate is fine really, but pick one and go there every time, it will be easier.
* Do damage!
  * If final stand is reached:
    * Its much like Rhulk, but he doesn't move that much and you can basically just keep doing what you're doing.
    * There is an immune phase between the end of normal damage and final stand.
    * Somewhat prudent to save supers though I suspect Nezerac will be an an easy 2 phase on normal, if not generally 1 phase-able.
* After damage is over, everyone should return to the edge of the arena where you spawn in.
  * This is to avoid Nezerac's void frisbee's which can one shot you on constest mode. 
  * Probably not necessary in a normal raid.
* Repeat the node connection steps as necessary.
  * If a secondary connection phase is needed, the [Anti-Wipe Mechanic](#4th-encounter---anti-wipe-mechanic) unless you are very fast.
  * Nezerac enrages after the third damage phase.

### 4th Encounter - Anti-Wipe Mechanic

This mechanic makes it specifically possible to survive Nezerac's wipe mechanic. It is possible to connnect the nodes fast enough for this to not be necessary but I suspect most teams will struggle with that.

* Once the person that is taking `Nezerac's Hatred` has done so and both shoulder crit spots are broken, the second shoulder break will emit a Light or Dark color.
* If the color is Dark, acquire `Field of Light` from the active Light node.
* Go to an inactive but connected Dark node and shoot it.
  * This node will now give those that pass through the node a buff which allows them to survive the wipe mechanic.
* If the color is Light, acquire `Flux of Darkness` from the active Dark node.
* Go to an inactive but connected Light node and shoot it.
  * This node will now give those that pass through the node a buff which allows them to survive the wipe mechanic.

*NB:* An inactive but connected node would be like the original starter node. As long as it doesn't have the aura and is more than just a helix it can be used to produce the anti-wipe buff.

#### 4th Encounter - Anti-Wipe Mechanic TL;DR

* Shoulder is dark -> get light -> shoot inactive but connected dark node
* Shoulder is light -> get dark -> shoot inactive but connected light node

### 4th Encounter - Loadouts

* Almost any high damage super.
  * Tether, Nova Bomb, Thundercrash, etc.
* Well of Radiance will make this very easy.
* Add clear supers are also very good.
* Guns:
  * Divinity +
    * Thunderlord
    * Izzy + Rocket (has big crit spot and doesn't move so it may not be *strictly necessary* to have a div)
  * Untested/not seen in action: 
    * Grenade Launchers (probably not good).
    * Rockets Only (Ghorn + TTF + Legendaries). 
    * Fusion Grenade spam.
